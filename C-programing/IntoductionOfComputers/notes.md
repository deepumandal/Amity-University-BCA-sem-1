# Introduction of computers

## Computer

It comes from the word "compute," which means to calculate. It is a device that operates on data.

### Basic Functions

It performs the following five basic operations for converting raw input data into useful information and presenting it to the user:

- **Inputting:** Process of entering data and instructions into a computer system.

- **Storing:** Saving data and instructions to make them readily available for initial or additional processing as and when required.

- **Processing:** Performing arithmetic operations (add, subtract, etc.) or logical operations (comparisons like equal to, less than, etc.) on data to convert them into useful information.

- **Outputting:** Process of producing useful information or results for a user, such as printed reports or visual displays.

- **Controlling:** It is like the brainâ€”it manages and directs the activities of the other parts of the computer. The control unit oversees the flow of data and instructions within the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and coordinates the actions of the entire computer system. The control unit interprets instructions from the computer's memory, decodes them, and then executes or carries out those instructions by directing the other parts of the computer to perform specific tasks.
